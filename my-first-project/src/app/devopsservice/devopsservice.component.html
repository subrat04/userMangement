                A DevOps team consists of developers and IT professionals who
                collaborate on a project throughout its lifecycle to advance the
                speed and improve software deployment. It's an innovative way of
                functioning with a cultural shift of prominent effects on teams
                and the entities for which they are operating.
                <br /><br />
                The teams responsible for development and operations are no
                longer "siloed" under a DevOps model. From design and testing to
                deployment and operations, these two teams possess various sorts
                of multidisciplinary skills and occasionally merge to form a
                solo team of engineers and designers who work throughout the
                software lifecycle.
                <br /><br />
                In some DevOps models, security and quality management teams can
                also become more deeply involved with development and operations
                throughout the application's lifecycle. These teams employ
                procedures to automate slow and manual processes from the past
                through technology stack and tooling that enables them to
                function effectively and expand applications progressively and
                fast.

                <br /><br />
                These tools also assist engineers in independently completing
                tasks (such as conducting code or deployment infrastructure)
                that generally might have required assistance from other teams
                which further increases a team's velocity.

                    DevOps teams release products more frequently and with
                    better stability and quality. In fact, according to the DORA
                    2019 State of DevOps report, high-performing teams deploy
                    208 times more often and 106 times faster than average
                    teams. Teams can use automated tools to test, create, and
                    deliver software through continuous delivery.

                    DevOps has been created in a cooperative climate where
                    development and operations teams cooperate and share tasks.
                    Teams become more effective as a result, and it also eases
                    hours spent on work handoffs and writing code that can be
                    tailored to the environment in which it will run.
