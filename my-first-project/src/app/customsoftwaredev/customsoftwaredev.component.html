                            This customized software build strives to meet a specific set of requirements in contrast with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. COTS must target a wide range of needs to be packaged, commercially marketed, and distributed. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">The software was created by keeping the mass market in mind. The software is known to come pre-packed with features that have been sold “off the shelf”. To subscribe to the updated versions, companies pay a licensing fee, which is maintained by the development vendor of the same project. </p>

                            <strong>Open Source Software:</strong>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Open-source software includes Microsoft Windows, for instance. Users don't need to think twice while performing daily computations with this apparatus. By employing similar procedures and methodologies, custom software can be easily developed and maintained just as any other software.   
                        </p>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            A custom project would follow the same steps as any other software project, such as gathering requirements, writing code, testing it, and deploying it. It would also use the same methodologies, such as Agile, DevOps, or Rapid Application Development.
                        </p>
                        <p  class="paragraph">
                            Consider this: a COTS is a public utility vehicle that considers the combined choices of travelers and drives at a fast enough speed to pacify those onboard. A customized piece of software can be modified to your preference and driven at higher speeds than those permitted by law.</p>

                                        Many businesses choose a ready-made software option only to discover later that it does not meet their needs. It can be difficult to find software that is suitable for every type of business, as every company is different.

Custom software uses the hardware that already exists, saving money and preventing the need to buy hardware that is not necessary.

                                    The purpose of custom software is to support your business rather than forcing it to fit the program. In the process of developing and integrating custom software, it is imperative to ensure maximum seamlessness across your entire business.
